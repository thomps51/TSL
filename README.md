# TSL

The vainly-and-uninspiredly-named Tony's Standard Library.  A place to put some base library components.

   - meta: metaprogramming tools such as value-to-type map
   - preprocessor: useful macros and such
   - type_traits: single compile-time traits you might find the in standard header of the same name
   - utility: things like scope_guard and other general things that don't fit elsewhere
